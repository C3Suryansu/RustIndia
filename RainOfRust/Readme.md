# RainofRust Campaign Kit

Rust is a state of art programming language for the modern day applications, which runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Main Aims:

RainofRust campaign aims at the following aspects:

* Creating more awareness about Rust language across the students and developer communities
* Inspire local Rust mobilizers to start regional user groups
* Cruating workshop kit to produce tangible outputs as deliverables of the event
* Use the existing communication channels to support Rust community members

### Goals and Scope:

* 30 Rust events (online/offline) in the month of June 2017
* Collaborate with Tech Speakers
* Reach to 500 Rust users
* Introduce Rust to students and professionals/developers
